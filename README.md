# Digital-Control-on-Power-Electronics
This is a package contained digital control schemes on power electronics converters.
A single phase voltage source inverter is set as an example to display that how to implement digital control on power electronics. The general configuration of my model is as follows:

As the purposes of high performance controllers design, the relationship between control signal and output measurement has to be considered. Pulse width modulation (PWM) is developed in this project which can be normally adopted to low-level control scheme. The more details of digital control on power inverter has been demonstrated as following:

System Identification is a kind of advanced digital control strategies to provide more information about model, for designing a model-based self-tuning PID controller.

The uploaded python code may provide a little help with researchers and engineerers are working on the area of digital control on power electronics.

The PDF will explain a straightforward methodology of getting the appropriate transfer function depending on your needs by some basic theories of electrical circuits and automatic control.

My programme is still in progress. More advanced control strategies will be released:)
